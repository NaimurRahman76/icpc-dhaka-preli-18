Given a range [L, R], find the number of integers in that range which have an odd number of odd divisors. 
​For example, 1 has only one divisor and it is odd, 9 has three divisors {1, 3, 9} and all of them are odd.
Meanwhile, 18 has six divisors {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18} but three of them are odd. So 1, 9 and 18 have an odd number of odd divisors.

Input

Input will start with a positive integer T (T ≤ 10​5​) denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case will have two positive integers L, R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10​18​)​, the range.

Output

For each test case, the first line will be the case number in the format “Case t: x” without the quotes. 
Here t is the case number starting from 1 and x is the number of integers that fall in the range [L, R]​ and have an odd number of odd divisors.
